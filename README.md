# Project Euler

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler challenges (see https://projecteuler.net/). So far I have mostly used the R language to do so, but this may change in the future. Needless to say, these solutions constitute SPOILERS - I would recommend looking at the challenges by yourself first.
