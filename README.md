# Project Euler

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler challenges (see https://projecteuler.net/). So far I have mostly used the R language to do so, but this may change in the future. Needless to say, these solutions constitute SPOILERS - I would recommend looking at the challenges by yourself first.
Note that the code usually isn't very efficient in providing the solution. I am not a professional programmer so I am sure there are better solutions out there. This is simply my way of solving the challenges.
